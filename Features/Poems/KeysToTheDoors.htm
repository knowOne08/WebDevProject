            <p>I loved your age of wonder: your third and fourth<br />
                and fifth years spent astonished, widening your eyes<br />
                at each new trick of the world&#8212;and me standing there,<br />
                solemnly explaining how it was done. The moon and stars,<br />
                rainbows, photographs, gravity, the birds in the air,<br />
                the difference between blood and water.<br />
                <i>In true life?</i> you would say, looking up<br />
                and I would nod, like some broken-hearted sage,<br />
                knowing there would be no answers soon<br />
                to all the big questions that were left, to cruelty and fear,<br />
                to age and grief and death, and no words either.<br />
                And you, like me, will sit and shake your head.<br />
                <i>In true life?</i> Yes, my sweet, strong daughter, I&#8217;m afraid<br />
                there is all this as well, and this is it: true life.</p>
